# README
This is the backend of the Exercise-Tracker project. This application was built using a rails api backend and a javascript front end. The front and backend are split into two different repositories.

For details about the front end, visit the following link: https://github.com/hannahmalm/tracker_frontend.git

To get started, fork and clone both respositories. Open the backend repo, run bundle install, and run rails s to start the server. If you would like to see the raw JSON data, visit "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/exercises". Once the server is started, open the frontend repository, and open the html within your browser to interact with the form and exercise tracker!
